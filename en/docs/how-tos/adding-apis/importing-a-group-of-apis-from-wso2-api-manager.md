# Importing a Group of APIs from WSO2 API Manager

!!! note
    This is only applicable if you wish to import your APIs from WSO2 API Manager.
    Follow guidelines on [configuring the API Manager]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/configuration-for-wso2-api-manager/) before following the below steps.

It is possible to create a Microgateway distribution for a group of APIs that exist in WSO2 API Manager, by simply importing the group of APIs based on a preferred Microgateway label, which has been assigned to the group of APIs in WSO2 API Manager. Similarly, you can also use a Microgateway label to import a single published API from WSO2 API Manager as well if required.

Follow the instructions below to create a Microgateway distribution for a group of APIs that you have imported from WSO2 API Manager.

### Step 1 - Follow the installation prerequisites

Make sure to carry out all the [installation prerequisites]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/install-on-vm/).

### Step 2 - Assign an API to an API Microgateway

Create and attach a Microgateway to an API. Follow the instructions in the [Grouping APIs with Microgateway Labels]({{apim_path}}/Learn/APIMicrogateway/grouping-apis-with-labels/) on the WSO2 API Manager documentation.

### Step 3 - Generate a Microgateway project

Follow the instructions below to generate a Microgateway project for a group of APIs that corresponds to a specific Microgateway label.

1.  Initialize an API Microgateway project (e.g., marketing\_project).
    Navigate to a preferred folder where you want to create the Microgateway project. Thereafter, run the following command.

    ``` bash tab="Format"
    micro-gw init <project-name>
    ```

    ``` bash tab="Example"
    micro-gw init marketing_project
    ```

    ``` bash tab="Response"
    Project 'marketing_project' is initialized successfully.
    ```

2.  Import the APIs, which are published in WSO2 API Manager, that correspond to a specific Microgateway label.

    !!! note
        In order to import APIs from API Manager 4.x versions, add the specific API Manager version configuration to the <MICROGW_HOME>/conf/toolkit-config.toml file. (The following configuration is for API Manager 4.0.0)
        
        ``` toml
        [token]
        apimVersion = "4.0.0"
        ```

        Note that the **-l** argument is required to specify the gateway environment when importing an API. The imported API will correspond to the latest deployed version of the specified gateway environment.

        Refer to the [compatibility documentation]({{base_path}}/faqs/#compatibility) to confirm the supported update level for this feature.
    
    ``` bash tab="Format"
    micro-gw import -l <label> <project-name> 
    ```

    ``` bash tab="Example"
    micro-gw import -l MARKETING_STORE marketing_project
    ```
    
    ``` bash tab="Response"
    WSO2 API Microgateway Toolkit prompts for the following.
   
    Enter Username: 
    admin
    Enter Password for admin: 
    Enter APIM base URL [https://localhost:9443]: 
    You are using REST version - v1.2 and dynamic client registration version - v0.17 of API Manager. (If you want to change this, go to <MGW-TK_HOME>/conf/toolkit-config.toml) 
    Enter Trust store location: [lib/platform/bre/security/ballerinaTruststore.p12]
    Enter Trust store password: [ use default? ]
    ID for API 30e623704c5c5479b7c0d9ab78e965df02c1610401e37cbd557e6353e3191c76
        
    - Username and Password - Enter your user credentials. The username and password should correspond to a valid user in WSO2 API Manager
    - APIM base URL - This is the WSO2 API Manager URL. If you want to use the default value, click enter.
    - Trust store location and password of WSO2 API Microgateway Toolkit - If you want to use the default value, click enter.
    ```
    
    After the APIs are imported, you can find the auto-generated OpenAPI definitions in the `<MGW-project>/gen/<OpenAPI_definition-file-name>.json` directory of the project (e.g., `/marketing_project/gen/30e623704c5c5479b7c0d9ab78e965df02c1610401e37cbd557e6353e3191c76swagger.json`)

### Step 4 - Build the Microgateway

Build the WSO2 API Microgateway project (e.g.,marketing\_project).

1.  Navigate to the `<MGW_HOME>/bin` directory and run the following command.

    ``` bash tab="Format"
    micro-gw build <project-name>
    ```

    ``` bash tab="Example"
    micro-gw build marketing_project
    ```

    ``` bash tab="Response"  
    Compiling source
    	wso2/marketing_project:3.2.0
    
    
    Creating balos
    	target/balo/marketing_project-2020r1-java8-3.2.0.balo
    
    Running Tests
    
    	wso2/marketing_project:3.2.0
    	No tests found
    
    
    Generating executables
    	target/bin/marketing_project.jar
    
    BUILD SUCCESSFUL
    Target: /Users/Downloads/TestProj/marketing_project/target/marketing_project.jar
    ```

    This creates a jar file ( `/marketing_project/target/marketing_project.jar` ) that you can use to expose the group of APIs via WSO2 API Microgateway.

### Step 5 - Run the Microgateway

Start WSO2 API Microgateway.

``` bash tab="Format"
gateway <path-to-MGW-jar-file>
```

``` bash tab="Example"
gateway /Users/kim/Downloads/TestProj/marketing_project/target/marketing_project.jar
```

WSO2 API Microgateway starts for the APIs, which are grouped with the `MARKETING_STORE` label.

``` bash
